- Developers can launch websites to the Internet using something known as web hosting.

- Web hosting is a service where you place your website and files on the hosting companies web server. 

- More stable and secure.

- These are the types of web hosting; shared hosting, virtual private hosting, dedicated hosting, and Cloud hosting.

(1) Shared hosting: The cheapest web hosting, in this we also share the service processing power, memory, and bandwidth with other websites that might slow your performance. 
- Good for a small website with a small number of visitors. 
- Many developers also use this as a low-cost sandbox environment to practice deploying or hosting their personal websites. 
- Some companies offer free shared hosting, but with limitations and often have advertisements embedded in the webpages.

(2) VPS hosting (Virtual Private Surface): It is a dedicated CPU, memory, and bandwidth rersources. 
- It will be running on a hardware server with other VPS instances but as the resources are fixed per VPS instance, your website is unlikely to be impacted by the performance of other VPS instances. - A VPS instance will be more expensive than shared hosting. 

(3) Dedicated hosting:  This will be a hardware server that is dedicated to you only.
- All hardware, CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources are yours to use.
- Generally, this option is more expensive than a VPS hosting.

(4) Cloud hosting: The website is run in something called a Cloud environment, which spans across multiple physical and virtual servers.
- If a physical or virtual server fails, your website will run on a different server and stay online.
- The main advantage of Cloud hosting is that you can use as many resources as you need without hardware limitations.
- Pay based on resource use.
- For example, if you transfer a file from the Cloud to a web browser, you'll pay for the bandwidth used for that transfer at a fractional cent cost per megabyte. While this can quickly become more expensive, is allows websites and web applications to scale their costs as popularity grows.

- This is how many of the major web applications operate.
