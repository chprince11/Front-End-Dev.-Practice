- A web browser, or browser for short, is a software application that you use to browse the World Wide Web. It works by sending a request to a web server and then receives a response containing the content that is to be displayed on the screen of your device.

- Once the browser is open on your device, there is the address bar where you input the address of the website that you want to visit. The address is commonly known as the Uniform Resource Locator or URL for short. The URL contains the protocol or the HTTP, the domain name, usually the name of the website, and the file path, or the path to the page that is displayed. When you make a request using this URL, the browser and server communicate using a protocol known as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP. 

- Now, let me demonstrate this using an example many of us are familiar with, searching the web. First, you open a web browser, which is a software application. Next, you type the name of your favorite search engine. The name you type contains something called a domain name. Then when you press Enter,
the web browser sends a request across a network and connects to another computer on the Internet called a web server.
The web server is a special type of computer that allows other computers to make requests for data. The web server responds by sending a webpage back to the browser. Once the browser receives all the response information, the search engine webpage is made visible. The web page is a coded document that is rendered by the browser and then presented visually to you, the end-user.
